### Replication Package - Table of Contents

The following table contains links to different parts of our replication package:

| Links        | Description 
| - | - |
| [Data Set](https://saner-decay-factors.github.io/replicationpackage.html) | Contains instructions and links to the different files that compose the dataset used in the paper. |
| [Manual Validation](https://saner-decay-factors.github.io/manualvalidation.html) | Provides the data and details about the execution of our manual validation. |
| [Software Metrics List](https://saner-decay-factors.github.io/softwaremetrics.html) | Presents the full list of software metrics used in this work to represent the internal quality attributes. |
| [Additional Analysis - Score Distribution](https://saner-decay-factors.github.io/visualization_score.html) | Provide a violin plot presenting the distribution per project of the score used to classify classes into slightly- and largely-decayed.|
| [Additional Analysis - Score Adequation](https://saner-decay-factors.github.io/score_adequation.html) | Additional analysis, aiming to observe whether the method used to calculate the decay score was adequate for our context, which is to improve maintainability.|
| [Additional Analysis - Closed Source vs. Open Source](https://saner-decay-factors.github.io/closed_open.html) | Additional analysis, aiming to observe whether there are differences in how design decay behaves between closed- and open-source systems.
| [Visualization - Association Rules](https://saner-decay-factors.github.io/visualization_rules.html) | Provide a set of visualizations (generated by the arulesviz R package) for the most relevant association rules mined in this work.|
